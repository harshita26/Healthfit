    <h1>My Journey With Psoriasis</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      Today, I want to share my journey so that anyone in the world who is living with psoriasis can feel less alone. If you are struggling with this condition, I hope my experience gives you strength and encourages you to explore a path that may help you heal—physically and emotionally.
    </p>

    <h2>When It All Began</h2>
    <p>
      I was 16–17 years old when psoriasis first appeared on my scalp. At that time, I didn’t even know the name of the disease. I thought it was just dandruff and ignored it. Slowly, it started spreading to other parts of my body, and that was when I became truly scared seeing my own skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I visited local doctors who prescribed ointments and medicines to control itching. The relief was temporary. If I skipped even one dose, the flare-ups returned. Over time, the continuous use of ointments made my skin thinner, and emotionally I felt exhausted.
    </p>

    <h2>Trying Every System of Medicine</h2>
    <p>
      I tried allopathy, homeopathy, and Unani treatments. Allopathy caused side effects. Homeopathy came with strict food restrictions that were difficult to follow in daily life. In 2016, I finally turned to Ayurveda and decided to undergo Panchakarma therapy.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding Panchakarma</h2>
    <p>
      Panchakarma is a traditional Ayurvedic detoxification therapy designed to cleanse the body, mind, and spirit. It focuses on removing toxins (ama) and balancing the three doshas—Vata, Pitta, and Kapha.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparation stage involved consuming medicated ghee every morning on an empty stomach. The quantity increased daily until it reached 300 ml on the seventh day. This process was physically and mentally challenging.
    </p>

    <h2>Giving Up and Facing Flare-Ups</h2>
    <p>
      Due to the strong smell and difficulty digesting the ghee, I stopped the treatment midway. Within days, the flare-ups returned. I lost hope and accepted that I might have to live with this disease forever.
    </p>

    <h2>Living With Shame and Silent Pain</h2>
    <p>
      During college, flare-ups on my face made me feel ashamed. I tried to hide myself and relied on ointments just to face people. I couldn’t wear the clothes I liked and often felt trapped in my own body.
    </p>

    <h2>Marriage and Emotional Breakdown</h2>
    <p>
      After marriage, my psoriasis flared up again. Despite believing I would be accepted, my marriage ended within 40 days because I couldn’t guarantee that the disease wouldn’t affect future generations. I was emotionally shattered and felt isolated and broken.
    </p>

    <h2>A Turning Point</h2>
    <p>
      My doctor reminded me that psoriasis is not purely genetic and cannot be predicted. Those words gave me strength. I decided to try Ayurveda again—with complete dedication.
    </p>

    <h2>Choosing Healing</h2>
    <p>
      I followed the Ayurvedic treatment sincerely, adhered to a strict diet, avoided milk, refined flour, half-cooked food, and wrong food combinations. This time, my mindset was clear: I would do everything needed to heal myself.

      Psoriasis is not just a skin condition—it affects confidence, relationships, and self-worth. But it does not define who you are.
