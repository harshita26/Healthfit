    <h1>My Journey With Psoriasis: From Fear and Shame to Healing and Hope</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      Today, I want to share my journey so that anyone in the world who is living with psoriasis can feel less alone. If you are struggling with this skin condition, I hope my experience gives you strength and encourages you to explore a path that may help you heal—physically and emotionally.
    </p>

    <h2>When It All Began</h2>
    <p>
      I was 16–17 years old when psoriasis first appeared on my scalp. At that time, I didn’t even know the name of the disease. I thought it was just dandruff and ignored it. Slowly, it started spreading to other parts of my body, and that was when I became truly scared, seeing my own skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t understand the seriousness of the condition. I visited local doctors who prescribed ointments and medicines to control itching. The relief was temporary. If I skipped even one dose, the flare-ups returned. Over time, the continuous use of ointments made my skin thinner, and emotionally, I felt exhausted.
    </p>

    <h2>Trying Every System of Medicine</h2>
    <p>
      In search of a cure, I tried allopathy, homeopathy, and Unani treatments. Allopathy caused side effects. Homeopathy came with strict food restrictions that were difficult to follow in daily life. In 2016, I finally turned to Ayurveda and decided to undergo Panchakarma therapy.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding Panchakarma</h2>
    <p>
      Panchakarma is a traditional Ayurvedic detoxification therapy designed to cleanse the body, mind, and spirit. It focuses on removing toxins (ama) and balancing the three doshas—Vata, Pitta, and Kapha.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preparation stage involved consuming medicated ghee every morning on an empty stomach. The quantity increased daily until it reached 300 ml on the seventh day. This process was physically and mentally challenging.
    </p>

    <h2>Giving Up and Facing Flare-Ups</h2>
    <p>
      Due to the strong smell and difficulty digesting the ghee, I stopped the treatment midway. Within days, the flare-ups returned. I lost hope and accepted that I might have to live with this disease forever.
    </p>

    <h2>Living With Shame and Silent Pain</h2>
    <p>
      During college, flare-ups on my face made me feel ashamed. I tried to hide myself and relied on ointments just to face people. I couldn’t wear the clothes I liked and often felt trapped in my own body.
    </p>
    <p>There were moments when my emotional pain became unbearable. I felt trapped in my own body. I had thoughts of ending my life because I couldn’t see a future without this disease. Those were dark times that I rarely spoke about.</p>

    <h2>Marriage and Emotional Breakdown</h2>
    <p>
      After marriage, my psoriasis flared up again. Despite believing I would be accepted, my marriage ended within 40 days because he asked me for a guarantee that this disease would not affect our future children. I couldn’t guarantee that the disease wouldn’t affect future generations. He chose to dissolve the marriage, saying he didn’t want to risk passing the condition to the next generation. 
      
    </p>
<p>I was completely shattered—mentally and emotionally. I started believing that I didn’t deserve to be a mother, that my child might suffer because of me. My husband stopped speaking to me. People around me made hurtful comments about my body. I felt broken, isolated, and worthless.</p>
    <h2>A Turning Point</h2>
    <p>
      My doctor reminded me that psoriasis is not purely genetic and cannot be predicted. Those words gave me strength. I decided to try Ayurveda again—with complete dedication.
    </p>

    <h2>Choosing Healing</h2>
    <p>
     I rejoined an Ayurvedic center with a completely different mindset. This time, I was determined to heal—not just my skin, but my life. The doctors created a strict diet plan, monitored my blood pressure, and restarted medicated ghee therapy.
    </p><p>
Earlier, when I tried this treatment at home, I vomited the ghee and didn’t follow the diet seriously. But this time, I made a promise to myself: I will do everything for my healing.
    </p>
    <p>That determination helped me tolerate the smell of the ghee, digest it, and follow a very light, disciplined diet exactly as advised. I eliminated milk, all-purpose flour, half-cooked food, and wrong food combinations from my life.</p>

    <div class="quote">
      Psoriasis is not just a skin condition—it affects confidence, relationships, and self-worth. But it does not define who you are. But it does not define you. Healing is not easy, and it is not instant—but it is possible when you choose yourself
    </div>
<h2>Avoid vs Healthy Alternatives</h2>
    <p>
      Healing is not just about treatment, but also about daily lifestyle choices. Below are some things I consciously avoided and the healthier alternatives I adopted.
